These beliefs are often oversimplified and may not reflect the diversity and complexity of the individuals within that group.Stereotypes can be both positive and negative, but they are problematic when they are used to unfairly judge or discriminate against individuals or groups. They can create biases and prejudices that affect how people are treated and can limit opportunities for those who do not conform to the stereotype.Stereotypes can be perpetuated by media, culture, and socialization, and can be difficult to change.
