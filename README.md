Codebase for constructing the ImplicitStero dataset using chat-GPT 3.5. Research seeks to understand if Chat-GPT 3.5 understands sterotypes from a source demographic group towards a target demographic group. Code executes, organizes, and cleans chat-GPT 3.5 generations. Findings from this work were published in "Deciphering Stereotypes in Pre-Trained Language Models" and accepted to [EMNLP 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.697/)
